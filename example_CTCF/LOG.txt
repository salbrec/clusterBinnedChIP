Some profiles are not available as binned profile, yet. Starting to apply the binning
to some (potentially all) profiles. This might take a few minutes. On 5kb resolution
it takes approx. 30 seconds for binning one profile. Time for a coffee, tea or mate?

Clustermap was created and saved into ./example_CTCF/clustermap_bins_GRCh38_5kb.png

Applied agglomerative single-linkage clustering and evaluated its quality.
The following measures represent the clustering quality:

        Adjusted Mutual Information: 0.71229
        Adjusted Rand Index:         0.58074
        Homogeneity Score:           0.79349
        Completeness Score:          0.85689
